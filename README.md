Magic state preparation on a surface code: a numerical demonstration
====================================================================

This project is on the starting state.
We will make it public after finishing it.

`surface_expand.ipynb`: testing how to expand a surface code quickly.

This project depends on packages:
```
stim ~= 1.15.0
sinter ~= 1.13.0
```
Note that sinter 1.15.0 causes issues with the current implementation. Please use sinter 1.13.0 for compatibility.
