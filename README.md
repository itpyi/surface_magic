Magic state preparation on a surface code: a numerical demonstration
====================================================================

This is a supplementary code for the paper [Magic teleportation with generalized lattice surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19758).
This is still not finished.

This project depends on packages:
```
stim ~= 1.15.0
sinter ~= 1.13.0
```
Note that sinter 1.15.0 causes issues with the current implementation. Please use sinter 1.13.0 for compatibility.
See this [StackExchange post](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/44364/how-to-use-sinter-to-collect-stats-with-postselection/44479#44479) for more details.
