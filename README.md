Magic state preparation on a surface code: a numerical demonstration
====================================================================

This repository contains supplementary code for the paper [Magic teleportation with generalized lattice surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19758).
**Please note that this repository is currently being organized to ensure that the results can be easily reproduced. It is not yet fully structured for reproduction, so visitors may encounter some disorganization.**

Note that sinter 1.15.0 causes issues with the current implementation. Please use sinter 1.13.0 for compatibility.
