- Test 1: QRM + surface prepared on X, surgery, and measure XX. 
  - FT.
  - Surgery does not propagate errors to make it bad.
- Test 2: non-standard QRM. Test if logically correct.
  - Incorrect. 
  - Question: why QRM needs standard but not SC?
- Test 3: QRM + surface prepared on S, surgery, and measure YY.
  - FT.
  - Final Y measurement on surface code is good.

It can only be that the readout of lattice surgery is not FT.
Why?
